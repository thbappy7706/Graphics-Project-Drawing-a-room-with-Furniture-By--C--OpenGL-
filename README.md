## Function Used
1. glColor3ub
    (The GL stores both a current single-valued color index and a current four-valued RGBA color. glcolor sets a new four-valued RGBA color. glcolor has two major variants: glcolor3 and glcolor4. glcolor3 variants specify new red, green, and blue values explicitly and set the current alpha value to 1.0 (full intensity) implicitly. glcolor4 variants specify all four color components explicitly.)
2. glVertex3f
    (The glVertex function commands are used within glBegin/glEnd pairs to specify point, line, and polygon vertices. The current color, normal, and texture coordinates are associated with the vertex when glVertex is called. When only x and y are specified, z defaults to 0.0 and w defaults to 1.0. When x, y, and z are specified, w defaults to 1.0. Invoking glVertex outside of a glBegin/glEnd pair results in undefined behavio.)
    
3 glVertex2i
     (The glVertex function commands are used within glBegin/glEnd pairs to specify point, line, and polygon vertices. The current color, normal, and texture coordinates are associated with the vertex when glVertex is called. When only x and y are specified, z defaults to 0.0 and w defaults to 1.0. When x, y, and z are specified, w defaults to 1.0. Invoking glVertex outside of a glBegin/glEnd pair results in undefined behavior.)
